		    <h2>About us</h2>
		    <p>
			We are an old fashioned family bakery and eatery that have been
			around for several generations of Grannies, with each recipe passed
			on as heirlooms. We are about tradition. We are about bonds. Granny's
			Pies is not just a business, it's our pride and joy. <br>
			<br>
			Because of the pride that we hold here, oven fresh goods and swift
			delivery is guaranteed. Come on in or give us a call for a nice afternoon.

			<h2>Granny</h2>
			<p>
			    The current owner of Granny's Pies, Mrs. Furukawa (古河), is a
			    5th generation Granny who has not only upheld traditional recipes
			    but brought forth many modern pastries to the table in order to keep
			    up with changing times. <br>
			    <br>
			    Since the moment she earned the title of maître pâtissier in 1956, both
			    formally and by the previous owner's judgement, Granny's Pies has seen
			    continued success.
